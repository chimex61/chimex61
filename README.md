Hi there, Chimex61 ~
Website www.straydos.com

I'm into Security Research.

🔭 I’m working on 👨‍🏭 Automation & 👷 DevOps!

🌱 I’m learning low level 🧰 stuff ... 👨‍💻.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate 🤝 on other security researchers research and build on them.

👋 I try to share what I have learnt or picked up along the way.

🥅 Main Goal: Network, Learn and Contribute more to Open Source projects.

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a hyper person and I loooove speeeed!! Ohhh + i 🥰 🐶
